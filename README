DESCRIPTION
------------
rloggerd is a simple script that allow send a log file to remote rsyslog server, by default using port udp/514. Basically it has two ways of working, a simple mode 
sends all the log file to the syslog server and daemon mode, with the option --daemon that will send only the new lines since rloggerd
was invoked with this option.

EXAMPLES
------------

- Send to syslog server 192.168.1.136 the file log /var/log/mysqld.log with the facility local1 and a priority info:

  ./rloggerd.pl --server 192.168.1.136 --file /var/log/mysqld.log --facility local1 --priority info
  
- Send new lines continuously of log /var/log/mysqld.log to syslog server with facility local0 and priority warn using tcp and prepend the text "hellow world"
  for each log line:

  ./rloggerd.pl --server 192.168.1.136 --file /var/log/mysqld.log --facility local0 --priority warning --socket tcp --tag "hello world" --daemon
